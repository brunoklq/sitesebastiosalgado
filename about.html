    <p>Sebastião Salgado is a renowned Brazilian photographer known for his powerful black-and-white images
         that capture social issues, human suffering, and the beauty of nature. Born on February 8, 1944, in Aimorés,
          Brazil, Salgado initially pursued a career in economics before discovering his passion for photography.

        Salgado's photography often focuses on themes such as labor, migration, poverty, and environmental
         degradation. He has traveled extensively to document these subjects, working in some of the most remote and 
         challenging environments around the world. His work is characterized by its meticulous composition, dramatic lighting,
          and deep emotional resonance.</p>
